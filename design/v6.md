## Interface configuration

Input:
    InterfaceInput {
        name,
        device,
        subnets: [
            Subnet {
                addr,
                mask,
            }
        ]?,
    }

::/128 - UNSPECIFED
::/0 - NO ROUTE

- Assigned addresses
  - linklocal: fe80::MAC in fe80::/10


Sequence (InterfaceConfiguration)
- Assign LL address
- NDP (ICMPv6) discover neighbors, esepcially routers
  - using multicast addr ff02::2 (router solicitation)
- Router send list of prefixes to assign addresses
- Assign unicast addrs

Sequence(Send Packet to dst)
- check source addr, based on socket (may be unspecified)
- check routing
  - is link-local -> OK
  - is local unicast -> look table
  - is nonlocal unicast -> look router
  - is local multicast -> later
  - is nonlocal mutlicast -> look router
- check NDP table
  - is local mutlicast -> MAC ff::ff
  - is unicast -> lookup
  - next_hop router -> maybe multicast router ??
- check whether src is combinable with dst
- send via specified interface
